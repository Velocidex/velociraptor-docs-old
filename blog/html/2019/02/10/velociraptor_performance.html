<h1>Velociraptor Performance</h1>
<p>We are often asked how much resources does a Velociraptor deployment
use? How should one spec a machine for a Velociraptor deployment? We
have previously said that one of the reasons we developed Velociraptor
was to improve on the performance of GRR which was not scalable for
our use case.</p>
<p>We’ve been working with the team at Klein &amp; Co. on several intrusions
over the past several months, which are providing valuable
opportunities to deploy and test Velociraptor in a range of real world
investigation scenarios. Through this process, we’ve been able to
extend Velociraptor’s functionality and prove its performance on real
client networks.</p>
<p>I thought I would write a short blog post to show how Velociraptor
performed on such a recent engagement. In this engagement we deployed
Velociraptor on AWS and selectively pushed the client to around 600
machines running a mix of MacOS and Windows.</p>
<p>This post will hopefully give readers some idea of how scalable the
tool is and the typical workloads we run with it.</p>
<div id="more"> </div><div class="section" id="the-server">
<h2>The Server</h2>
<p>Since this is a smallish deployment we used a single VM with 32Gb of
RAM and 8 cores. This was definitely over speced for this job as most
of the time the server consumed less than 10% of one core:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">top - 06:26:13 up 29 days,  2:31,  5 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can see that the server consumed about 95mb when operating
normally and CPU usage was around 3% of one core.</p>
<p>For this engagement we knew that we would be collecting a lot of data
and so we specified a large 500gb volume.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hunt-performance">
<h2>Hunt performance</h2>
<p>Velociraptor works by collecting “Artifacts” from clients. Artifacts
are simply encapsulated VQL queries which specify something to search
for on the endpoint. Without going into the details of this
engagement, we can say that we collected typical artifacts for a
DFIR/Forensic investigation engagement. In the following I want to
explore how well hunts performed for the following typical artifacts
in order of complexity:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Search the filesystem for a file glob.</li>
<li>Download the $MFT from the root filesystem.</li>
<li>Run a Yara scan over every file on all mounted filesystems.</li>
</ol>
<p>We ran these artifact collections over a large number of hosts
(between 400-500) that fell within the scope of our
engagement. Although the number of hosts is not huge, we hope to
demonstrate Velociraptor’s scalability.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="searching-for-a-file-glob">
<h2>Searching for a file glob</h2>
<p>One of the simplest and most common tasks in DFIR is to search the
filesystem for a glob based on filename. This requires traversing
directories and matching the filename based on the user specified
expression - for example, find all files with the extension <cite>*.exe</cite>
within the <cite>C:\Users</cite> directory.</p>
<p>Velociraptor can glob over the entire filesystem or over a limited set
of files. Typically a full filesystem glob can take some minutes on
the endpoint (it is equivalent to running the <cite>find</cite> unix command) and
touches every file. We typically try to limit the scope of the glob as
much as possible (e.g. only search system directories) but sometimes
it is nice to run a glob over all mounted filesystems to make sure we
don’t miss anything. In this case we opted for a full filesystem scan.</p>
<p>We searched the entire deployment using a hunt (The hunt is
constructed using the <cite>File Finder</cite> flow in the GUI) which just
launches the artifact collection. Therefore the horizontal distance
between the red and blue dot, in the graph below, represents the total
time taken by the host to collect the artifact.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/FileNameSearch.svg" src="../../../_images/FileNameSearch.svg" /><p>The graph shows how many hosts were recruited into this hunt on the Y
axis. The X axis show the number of seconds since the hunt launch. The
red points indicate the time when clients started their collection,
while the blue dots indicate the time when the client completed the
artifact collection and the server saved its results.</p>
<p>The inset shows the same data but zoomed into the time origin.</p>
<p>Velociraptor improves and builds on the initial ideas implemented
within the GRR DFIR tool, and so it is interesting to compare this
graph to a typical graph produced by GRR’s hunt (reproduced from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742287613000285">this paper</a>).</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/grr_hunt.png" src="../../../_images/grr_hunt.png" />
<p>The first noticeable difference is that Velociraptor clients complete
their collection much faster than GRR’s (the horizontal distance
between the red and blue dots represents the time between when the
collection is issued and the time it completes).</p>
<p>The main reason for this is that GRR’s communication protocol relies
on polling (by default every 10 minutes). Also, since hunting is so
resource intensive in GRR, the clients actually poll the hunt foreman
task every 30 minutes by default. This means that GRR clients
typically have to wait up to 30 minutes to run a hunt!</p>
<p>The second difference is the slope of the line around the start of the
hunt. GRR implements a hunt client rate - clients are recruited into
the hunt slowly (by default 20 per minute) in order to limit the load
on the frontends.  Unlike GRR, Velociraptor does not implement a hunt
rate since the Velociraptor frontend load is controlled by limiting
concurrency instead (more on this below).</p>
<p>This means that Velociraptor can deliver useful results within seconds
of the hunt starting. We see that this particular filename search
typically takes 25-30 seconds and we see about 200 clients completing
the hunt within this time consistently. The remaining clients are
probably not online and they receive the hunt as they join the
network. This makes Velociraptor hunts far more responsive and useful.</p>
<p>You might also notice a few outliers which spend a long time
collecting this artifact - these machines have probably been shutdown
or suspended while collecting this artifact.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mft-download">
<h2>MFT Download</h2>
<p>A common technique is to examine the Master File Table (MFT) of an
NTFS volume. By forensically analyzing the MFT it is possible to
detect deleted files, time stomping and build a timeline of the system
using tools like
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dkovar/analyzeMFT">analyseMFT.py</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="https://dmitrybrant.com/ntfswalker">ntfswalker</a> .</p>
<p>In this case we decided to collect the $MFT from all the Windows hosts
and post-process them offline. Typically the MFT is around 300-400mb
and could be larger. Therefore this artifact collection is about
performance downloading large quantities of data from multiple hosts
quickly.</p>
<p>Velociraptor can read the raw NTFS partition and therefore read the
<cite>$MFT</cite> file. We wrote the following artifact to just fetch the $MFT
file:</p>
<div class="highlight-yaml notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">name</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Artifact.NTFS.MFT_puller</span>

   <span class="no">Uses an NTFS accessor to pull the $MFT</span>

  <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">default</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">\\.\C:\$MFT</span>

<span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">sources</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">precondition</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span>
    <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">SELECT OS From info() where OS = &#39;windows&#39;</span>
  <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">queries</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span>
  <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">SELECT upload(file=path, accessor=&quot;ntfs&quot;) as Upload from scope()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here is the timing graph for this artifact collection:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/MFTDownload.svg" src="../../../_images/MFTDownload.svg" /><p>This collection takes a lot longer on each host as clients are
uploading around 400mb each to the server, but our server was in the
cloud so it had fast bandwidth. Again we see the hosts that are
currently up being tasked within seconds, while as hosts come online
gradually we see them receiving the hunt and a few minutes later
uploading their $MFT file.</p>
<p>Was the frontend loaded at the time? I took a screenshot of <cite>top</cite> on
the server seconds after launching the hunt:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/UploadingMFT.png" src="../../../_images/UploadingMFT.png" />
<p>We can see that the CPU load is trivial (4.7%) but the major impact of
a heavy upload collection is the memory used (about 4.7gb - up from
about 100mb). The reason is that each client is posting a large buffer
of data (several mb) simultaneously. The server needs to buffer the
data before it can decrypt and process it which takes memory.</p>
<p>In order to limit the amount of memory used, Velociraptor limits the
total number of connections it is actively processing to 8-10
concurrent connections. By carefully managing concurrency we are able
to keep a limit on server memory use. We may lower the total memory
use by reducing the concurrency (and therefore maybe fit into a
smaller VM). Clients simply wait until the server is able to process
their uploaded buffers. If the server takes too long, the clients
automatically back off and retry to send the same buffer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="yara-scan-over-the-entire-filesystem">
<h2>Yara scan over the entire filesystem</h2>
<p>The final example of a very intense artifact is to scan the entire
filesystem with a YARA rule. This not only requires traversing the
entire filesystem, but also opening each file and searching it.</p>
<p>One of the dangers with such a scan is that users will be negatively
impacted as their workstations start to read every file on disk! The
main resources a YARA scan consumes is disk IO and CPU load. Users
might complain and blame Velociraptor for their machine being slow
(disk IO may negatively affect performance much more than CPU load!).</p>
<p>However in this case, we don’t care how long we take to scan the
user’s system, as long as every file was scanned, and as long as the
endpoint is not overloaded and the user’s work is not
affected. Luckily Velociraptor allows us to specify the trade-off
between collection time and collection intensity.</p>
<div class="section" id="velociraptor-rate-limiting">
<h3>Velociraptor rate limiting</h3>
<p>Velociraptor controls client side load by rate limiting the client’s
VQL query. Each VQL plugin consumes an <cite>“operation”</cite> from the
throttler. We define an “operation” as a notional unit of work - the
heavier the VQL plugin’s work, the more operations are consumed. For
example for yara scanning, an operation is defined as 1mb of scanned
data, or a single file if the file is smaller.</p>
<p>When a user issues an artifact collection task, they may limit the
rate at which operations are performed by the client. The Velociraptor
agent then limits the operations to the specified rate. For example,
if the rate is 20 ops/sec then the client will scan less than 20mb per
seconds.</p>
<p>Other collections may run concurrently at different rates, though; The
client is not blocked while performing a single artifact
collection. This makes sense since we often need to collect a low
priority artifact slowly, but we do not want this to compromise rapid
response to that host.</p>
<p>For example, one of our targets was a server with large attached
storage. We ran the Yara scan over this system, scanning the first
100Mb of each file, at a rate of 50 ops/sec. In total we scanned 1.5Tb
of files and the scan took 14 hours (for a total scan rate of
30Mb/sec).</p>
<p>Velociraptor by default collects the <cite>Generic.Client.Stats</cite> artifact,
which samples the client’s CPU utilization and memory usage every 10
seconds. These samples are streamed to the server and form a record of
the client’s footprint on the endpoint. We can use this data to
visualize the effects of performing the yara scan on this host:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/cpu_utilization.svg" src="../../../_images/cpu_utilization.svg" /><p>Above is the CPU usage on that particular server over the course of a
full day (24 hours). The 14 hour yara scan is clearly visible but at
no time is CPU utilization exceeding 30% of one core. With endpoint
disk IO limited to about 30mb/sec we have achieved a balance between
performance and endpoint load we are happy with.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/YaraScanFull.svg" src="../../../_images/YaraScanFull.svg" /><p>We can see that most endpoints take approximately an hour to perform
this yara scan, but server load is minimal since the server simply
stores the results of the scans while doing minimal processing.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>This post provides some typical numbers for Velociraptor performance
in typical DFIR engagements. We also covered some considerations and
trade-offs we must think about when issuing large artifact
collections. Readers can use these as a guideline in their own

experiences. Velociraptor is under very active development and this
feedback is important to ensure we put in place the mechanisms to
account for more use cases.</p>
