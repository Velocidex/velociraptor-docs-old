            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Deploying Velociraptor with OAuth SSO</h1>
<p>In the previous post we saw how to set up Velociraptor’s GUI over
SSL. This is great, but we still need to create users and assign them
passwords manually. The trouble with user account management is that
we can not enforce 2 factor authentication, or any password policies
or any of the usual enterprise requirements for user account
management. It is also difficult for users to remember yet another
password for a separate system, and so might make the password easily
guessable.</p>
<p>Most enterprise systems require an SSO mechanism to manage user
accounts and passwords. Manual user account management simply does not
scale!</p>
<p>In this post we discuss how to enable Google’s SSO authentication for
Velociraptor identity management.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Configuring Velociraptor for SSL</h1>
<p>We have previously seen how to deploy a new Velociraptor server. For a
simple deployment we can have Velociraptor server and clients
provisioned in minutes.</p>
<p>Usually we deploy a specific Velociraptor deployment on our DFIR
engagements. We use cloud resources to provision the server and have
the clients connect to this cloud VM. A proper secure deployment of
Velociraptor will use SSL for securing both client communication and
protecting the web GUI.</p>
<p>In the past provisioning an SSL enabled web application was complex
and expensive - you had to create certificate signing requests,
interact with a CA. Pay for the certificates, then configure the
server. In particular you had to remember to renew the cert in 2 years
or your website suddenly broke!</p>
<p>Those days are over with the emergence of Lets Encrypt! and
autocert. These days applications can automatically provision their
own certificates. Velociraptor can manage its own certificates, fully
automatically - and then renew its certificates when the time comes
with no user intervention required.</p>
<p>In this blog post we will see how to configure a new Velociraptor
server in a cloud VM.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Velociraptor Interactive Shell</h1>
<p>One of the interesting new features in the latest release of
Velociraptor is an interactive shell. One can interact with the end
point over the standard Velociraptor communication mechanism - an
encrypted and authenticated channel.</p>
<p>This feature is implemented by utilizing the Velociraptor event
monitoring, server side VQL queries. This post explores how these
components come together to deliver a responsive, interactive
workflow.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Server side VQL queries and Escalation Events</h1>
<p>Previously we have seen how Velociraptor collects information from end
points using Velociraptor artifacts. These artifacts encapsulate user
created queries using the Velociraptor Query Language (VQL). The power
of VQL is that it provides for a very flexible way of specifying
exactly what should be collected from the client and how - without
needing to modify client code or deploy new clients!</p>
<p>This is not the whole story though! It is also possible to run VQL
queries on the server side! Similarly server side Velociraptor
artifacts can be used to customize the operation of the server -
without modifying any code or redeploying the server components.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>More on client event collection</h1>
<p>Previously we have seen that Velociraptor can monitor client events
using Event Artifacts. To recap, Event Artifacts are simply artifacts
which contain event VQL queries. Velociraptor’s VQL queries do not
have to terminate by themselves - instead VQL queries may run
indefinitely, trickling results over time.</p>
<p>This post takes another look at event queries and demonstrates how
these can be used to implement some interesting features.</p>

<p>In previous posts we have seen how Velociraptor can run artifacts to
collect information from hosts. For example, we can collect WMI
queries, user accounts and files.</p>
<p>However it would be super awesome to be able to do this collection in
real time, as soon as an event of interest appears on the host, we
would like to have that collected on the server. This post describes
the new event monitoring framework and shows how Velociraptor can
collect things such as event logs, process execution and more in real
time.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Detecting powershell persistence with Velociraptor and Yara</h1>
<p>I was watching the SANS DFIR Summit 2018 videos on youtube and came
across Mari DeGrazia’s talk titled <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWC7fzhvAY8">“Finding and Decoding Malicious Powershell Scripts”</a>.
This is an excellent talk and it really contains
a wealth of information. It seems that Powershell is really popular
these days, allowing attacker to “live off the land” by installing
fully functional reverse shells and backdoors, in a few lines of
obfuscated scripts.</p>

<p>The latest release of Velociraptor introduces the ability to access
raw NTFS volumes, allowing users to read files which are normally

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Files, files everything is just a file!</h1>
<p>GRR’s original design abstracted the data storage to a simple
key/value store originally based around Bigtable. For open source
deployments various key value stores were used starting from MongoDB,
to SQLite and finally MySQL. Although the original idea was to use a
simple key/value implementation, due to locking requirements the data
store implementation became very complex.</p>
<p>As Velociraptor introduced a major redesign of the underlying data
store architecture, we are now able to relax our demands of the
datastore and use a true key/value model (since we have no
requirements for locking and synchronization). The default data store
is now the FileBasedDataStore which stores all data in flat files.</p>

<p>Browsing the client’s filesystem is probably the first thing
responders do. Both GRR and Velociraptor have a nice VFS abstraction
that allows users to browse files interactively. However, in order to
make Velociraptor much faster we made some tradeoffs and improved the
way that the VFS is stored in the datastore.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Hunting - What Velociraptors do best!</h1>
<p>A hunt is a feature where a single flow may be run on multiple clients
at the same time. Typically a hunt looks for a particular indicator of
compromise across the entire deployment, or maybe collect the same
files from every deployed agent. By their nature, hunts cause multiple
flows to run simultaneously and so this creates a large contention of
shared state.</p>
<p>Velociraptor has completely redesigned the way that hunts are
implemented in order to avoid database locking and increase hunt
processing efficiency.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Interrogation - Make the endpoint tell us what it knows!</h1>
<p>Interrogation is the process of learning general information about the
endpoint we are monitoring. Each endpoint is automatically
interrogated when it first joins the Velociraptor server, and the GUI
shows this general information about each client.</p>
<p>When writing Velociraptor we decided to keep things very simple - we
did away with a lot of the information gathered during interrogate in
favor of a much simpler data model.</p>

<p>One of the main motivators for developing Velociraptor is the
opportunity to try different approaches than GRR. Velociraptor has a
number of fundamental design differences in contrast with the GRR
design which improve overall performance and scalability.  We tried to
keep it light weight cutting out the features we think we did not need
and leaving behind a fast, lean and mean raptor!</p>

<h2>Hunting and responding like a raptor!</h2>
<p>At Velocidex we have been running open source endpoint monitoring
tools for our clients in order to detect and respond to incidents.
One of our favorite tools is GRR, developed by Google internally and
then released as open source. GRR is a very powerful tool, with a
polished UI and good documentation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the open source version released by Google suffers from
some shortcomings and so we have decided to develop a new project,
built on the shoulders of giants called Velociraptor.</p>
