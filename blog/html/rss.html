            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Event Queries and Endpoint Monitoring</h1>
<p>In previous posts we have seen how Velociraptor can run artifacts to
collect information from hosts. For example, we can collect WMI
queries, user accounts and files.</p>
<p>However it would be super awesome to be able to do this collection in
real time, as soon as an event of interest appears on the host, we
would like to have that collected on the server. This post describes
the new event monitoring framework and shows how Velociraptor can
collect things such as event logs, process execution and more in real
time.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Detecting powershell persistence with Velociraptor and Yara</h1>
<p>I was watching the SANS DFIR Summit 2018 videos on youtube and came
across Mari DeGrazia’s talk titled <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWC7fzhvAY8">“Finding and Decoding Malicious Powershell Scripts”</a>.
This is an excellent talk and it really contains
a wealth of information. It seems that Powershell is really popular
these days, allowing attacker to “live off the land” by installing
fully functional reverse shells and backdoors, in a few lines of
obfuscated scripts.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Velorciraptor’s filesystem’s accessors</h1>
<p>The latest release of Velociraptor introduces the ability to access
raw NTFS volumes, allowing users to read files which are normally
locked by the operating system such as registry hives, pagefile and
other locked files. In addition, Velociraptor can now also read
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/vss/volume-shadow-copy-service-portal">Volume Shadow Copy</a>
snapshots. The gives a kind of time-machine ability to allow the
investigator to look through the drive content at a previous point in
the past.</p>
<p>This blog post introduces the new features and describe how
Velociraptor’s filesystem accessors work to provide data from multiple
sources to VQL queries.</p>

<p>In the latest point release of the Velociraptor IR tool (0.2.3) we

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Files, files everything is just a file!</h1>
<p>GRR’s original design abstracted the data storage to a simple
key/value store originally based around Bigtable. For open source
deployments various key value stores were used starting from MongoDB,
to SQLite and finally MySQL. Although the original idea was to use a
simple key/value implementation, due to locking requirements the data
store implementation became very complex.</p>
<p>As Velociraptor introduced a major redesign of the underlying data
store architecture, we are now able to relax our demands of the
datastore and use a true key/value model (since we have no
requirements for locking and synchronization). The default data store
is now the FileBasedDataStore which stores all data in flat files.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Browsing around the filesystem.</h1>
<p>Browsing the client’s filesystem is probably the first thing
responders do. Both GRR and Velociraptor have a nice VFS abstraction
that allows users to browse files interactively. However, in order to
make Velociraptor much faster we made some tradeoffs and improved the
way that the VFS is stored in the datastore.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Hunting - What Velociraptors do best!</h1>
<p>A hunt is a feature where a single flow may be run on multiple clients
at the same time. Typically a hunt looks for a particular indicator of
compromise across the entire deployment, or maybe collect the same
files from every deployed agent. By their nature, hunts cause multiple
flows to run simultaneously and so this creates a large contention of
shared state.</p>
<p>Velociraptor has completely redesigned the way that hunts are
implemented in order to avoid database locking and increase hunt
processing efficiency.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Interrogation - Make the endpoint tell us what it knows!</h1>
<p>Interrogation is the process of learning general information about the
endpoint we are monitoring. Each endpoint is automatically
interrogated when it first joins the Velociraptor server, and the GUI
shows this general information about each client.</p>
<p>When writing Velociraptor we decided to keep things very simple - we
did away with a lot of the information gathered during interrogate in
favor of a much simpler data model.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Design differences between Velociraptor and GRR</h1>
<p>One of the main motivators for developing Velociraptor is the
opportunity to try different approaches than GRR. Velociraptor has a
number of fundamental design differences in contrast with the GRR
design which improve overall performance and scalability.  We tried to
keep it light weight cutting out the features we think we did not need
and leaving behind a fast, lean and mean raptor!</p>

<h2>Hunting and responding like a raptor!</h2>
<p>At Velocidex we have been running open source endpoint monitoring
tools for our clients in order to detect and respond to incidents.
One of our favorite tools is GRR, developed by Google internally and
then released as open source. GRR is a very powerful tool, with a
polished UI and good documentation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the open source version released by Google suffers from
some shortcomings and so we have decided to develop a new project,
built on the shoulders of giants called Velociraptor.</p>
